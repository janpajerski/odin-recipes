        <p class = "description">Welcome to my recipes project. This is my first project in the Odin Project currriculum. It is a basic website with three recipes that I like. <i>Dad's Pork</i> is one that I wrote from memory and often cook at home. The other two, <i>Angela's Awesome Enchiladas</i> and <i>Baked Ziti</i>, were taken from <a class="link" href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">allrecipes.com</a>. Although not my own, they look amazing and I can't wait to try them at home!</p>

        <p>Check out the recipes, try them at home, and <a class="link" href="mailto:janpajerski@gmail.com">let me know</a> what you think.</p>
