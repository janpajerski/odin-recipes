<p>The recipes website is the first project in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

<p>It is a website to practice basic html. Headings, paragraphs, links - absolute and relative, images, and website structure. I am doing the basics for practice and no more. My time will be better spent on future projects with more complexity.</p>
