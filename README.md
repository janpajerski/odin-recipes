<p>The recipes website is the first project in <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>.</p>

<p>It is a website to practice basic html. Headings, paragraphs, links - absolute and relative, images, and website structure. I am doing the basics for practice and no more. My time will be better spent on future projects with more complexity.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>The project went smoothly and I reinforced what I learned about basic html: headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, website structure, and navigation. I became more familiar with VScode, particularly the ability to autofill html elements. It sped the process of codeing a page significantly. I practiced using the Linux command line to create files, directories, and copy files. Likewise, I became more familiar with the use of Git and GitHub. I didn't commit enough, likely because this project was so straighforward. Nonetheless, next time, I will commit changes more often.</p>
